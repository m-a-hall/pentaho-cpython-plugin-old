Pentaho CPython Plugin
=======================

The Pentaho R CPython Project is a plugin for the Pentaho Kettle engine which provides the ability to execute a python script (via the cpython environment) within the context of a transformation.

Building
--------
The Pentaho CPython Plugin is built with Apache Ant and uses Apache Ivy for dependency management. All you'll need to get started is Ant 1.7.0 or newer to build the project. The build scripts will download Ivy if you do not already have it installed.

    $ git clone git://github.com/pentaho/pentaho-cpython-plugin.git
    $ cd pentaho-cpython-plugin
    $ ant resolve dist

This will produce a plugin archive in dist/pentaho-cpython-plugin-${project.revision}.zip. This archive can then be extracted into your Pentaho Data Integration plugin directory.

Further Reading
---------------
You will need to have python installed on your machine. Either >= 2.7 in the 2.x version of python or 3.x. In addition, the following python packages are required:

pandas (>= 0.7.0)
numpy

The Anaconda distribution of python is a simple way to get started (especially for Windows users) as it comes with hundreds of packages pre-installed.
